# Bloccit 

Web App allowing users to create and share popular topics and articles

# Concept

This project is an inspiration Reddit and that what I was trying to achieve, it was my first major coding project ever and it centered around creating a site where users can create topics and creates posts to those said topics.

It wasnâ€™t an original idea, but merely a project to test my skills in web development, none the less this project is still a fully fletched out one with various amounts of features, from liking and favoriting, to creating posts, to making user profiles the option to incorporating a user profile picture, to creating comments.

# Sign Up

When going the url, the user is treated with a simple login page in which users can sign in/sign up, tabs in which guests or users who are not loggin can still navigate.

To start off, a User has choice of signing up or signing in a created account.
Once a user has created an account, they will get notified a email to vertify their email that they signed up with
